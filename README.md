## Introduction
- JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language.
- It is a programming language that is characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.
- JavaScript is a language that is used to create interactive effects within web browsers.

## Variables
- Variables are containers for storing data values.
- In JavaScript, variables are declared with the var, let, or const keyword.
- The var keyword is used to declare a variable that is scoped to the function in which it is declared.
- The let keyword is used to declare a variable that is scoped to the block in which it is declared.
- The const keyword is used to declare a variable that is scoped to the block in which it is declared and cannot be reassigned.

## Data Types
- JavaScript has six primitive data types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, and symbol.
- JavaScript has one complex data type: object.
- JavaScript has two additional data types: function and array.


## Operators
- JavaScript has several types of operators: arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, bitwise, and more.
- Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on numbers.
- Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
- Comparison operators are used to compare two values.
- Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.
- Bitwise operators are used to perform bitwise operations on numbers.
